## Assignment 1

See my answers [here](https://oyvinddd.github.io/inf273/).

## Assignment 2

Implementation relevant to assignemnt 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/oyvinddd/inf273/blob/master/util/parser.go) (parser) and [here](https://github.com/oyvinddd/inf273/blob/master/solution/solution.go) (functions for generating a random solution, checking feasibility and calculating the objective function).

The code for the assignment was written in [Go](https://golang.org/). Use the command ``go run *.go`` inside the project directory to run the program.
