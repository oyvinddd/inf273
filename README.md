The code for the assignment was written in [Go](https://golang.org/). After installing Go, use the command ``go get github.com/oyvinddd/inf273`` to download the program (by doing this, the files will be downloaded directly to your $GOPATH/src directory). To run the program simply type the command ``go run *.go`` inside the project directory.
